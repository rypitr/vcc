# vcc: the next generation of chat platform
## Introduction
Very cool chat (short form vcc) is a new way for chat which is faster, more secure, more open and powerful, you canâ€™t live without it once you use it. 
There are 2 parts in vcc, including rpc (server and service) and gateways. 
## Usage (for a normal user)
You can easily use it using gateways. There are currently three official gateways designed for normal users: 
* web-vcc supports nearly all features, but it requires modern browsers and has poor support for mobile devices.
* vcc-godot supports fewer features,but it is much more friendly to mobile users.
* vos (vcc on ssh) is designed for new hackers, but it supports few features.
You can choose any of them to use.
## Usage (for anyone who wants to deploy in his own server)
