# vcc: the next generation of chat platform
## Introduction
Very cool chat (short form vcc) is a new way for chat which is fast, secure, open and powerful, you can’t live without it once you use it. 
There are 2 parts in vcc, including rpc (server and service) and gateways. 
## Usage (for a normal user)
You can easily use it using gateways. There are currently three official gateways designed for normal users: 
* web-vcc supports nearly all features, but it requires modern browsers and has poor support for mobile devices, you can try it on [Demo web-vcc](chat.vcc.intirain.cc)
* vcc-godot supports fewer features,but it is much more friendly to mobile users.
* vos (vcc on ssh) is designed for new hackers. 
You can choose any of them to use.
